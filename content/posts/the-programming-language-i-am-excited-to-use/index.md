When you starting a new project, choosing a programming language is a hard choice. Here is my take.

On one had you might want to chose a _cool_ languge but on other hand you might want to chose a _stable_ language. 
## For 
web servers or any _general-purpose production_ system

---
## My criteria
* Static typing 
* Compiled 
* Good community support 
* Good libraries 
* Good frameworks 
* Functional 
* Memory management 
* Easy (relatively not steep learning curve)

## My criteria - language choice
**Static typing** (Because error-prone, Performance optimization)

Java, C, Rust, Go (sorry python and javascript)

**Compiled** (Performance, Memory)

Java, C, Rust, Go

**Good community support** (Don't want to be alone using the best programming language)

Java, C, Rust, Go, Python, Javascript

**Good libraries** (Don't want to reinvent the world)

Java, Javascript, Python, Go

**Good frameworks** (Library is okay but full fledge framework is required!)

Java, Javascript, Python, Go(Still evolving)

**Functional** (I am not a rigid OOP guy)

Javascript, Go

**Memory management** (As they say, if you want to make a pie from scratch, you must first create the universe. C is good but Assembly is best. I need productivity.)

Java (Nearly there), Javascript (lousy), Rust (Awesome), Go

**Easy** (relatively not steep learning curve) (Need talent already knowing lang or can be learned easily)

Python, Javascript, Go

## My choice
_**`Go`**_ (easy, good syntax, static typing and compiles fast, many libraries)

What I don't like about Go?
* Solid framework like spring. 
* Module management (prove me wrong!) 
* No generics (Maybe that is for good!) 
* Extra things like liquibase integration 

_Edit 1_

_**`Kotlin, spring-native, and GraalVM`**_ (Maybe)
> The day `go` will have all features as java, java will be as fast as go 
>
> \- _Graeme Rocher_ (creator of Groovy, Grails, Micronaut)

With GraalVM & spring-native or micronaut, we get compiled code

With Kotlin, we get awesome syntax, functional support within Java ecosystem. 

So maybe **_Kotlin, spring-native, and GraalVM_**. Depends on the preference of other stakeholders, existing knowledge, etc.

## Honorary mentions

**Python**: Easy  

However, I think pandas, numpy, jupyter notebook are the reasons for python's popularity

Good to start but not good performance/memory wise in production

Contrary to popular belief _I don't like python_. Because you need javascript in frontend for sure, some compiled lang in backend for sure then why learn a new language, use either of them - use max two!

Huge respect though. Easiest to get started with. Not chosen because I am searching for prod server language.

**Java**: Almost chose.

You go anywhere, you find java. You need to do anything, you can do it in java. The best thing, you don't need to depend on any other languages like python/javascript which are just a wrapper of C code

Not compiled. Still needs relatively higher memory - this is the reason I didn't choose it, bit slower than compiled - at least I have been told so

**C**: Best. But when I need a needle I won't use a sword.

**C++**: Controversial. Linus doesn't like it. Anyways almost like C.

**Rust**: Awesome memory management.

Doesn't shine when need things faster - from my 30k feet view (correct me if I am wrong).

Also not good at frameworks.

**Javascript**: Never thought it would become so popular.

Easy.

You can do almost anything. Hugely error prone, lousy memory management

However, bootstraping doesn't require too much memory. For simple programs, it takes less than 100MBs as compared to java which requires 500MBs. Even if javascript requires chrome engine to work. I have chosen this for simple rest APIs or simple kafka consumers because of best time to market.

Not to forget almost _best event based paradigm_. Love it for IO.  

**Typescript**: Huge fan.

Don't like it because it still compiles to javascript. Otherwise easy, great tooling, great community support. Great overall.

_The day typescript will have its own compiler, I will use this._

**Kotline, Scala, Groovy**: What typescript is for javascript, these languages are for java

**Clojure**: Because Lisp. However not sure much. Still compiles to java!

**C#**: Java's brother (or Sister!). I am anyways opensource guy.

**PHP**: Are they still using it! Wordpress. If you remove wordpress never seen PHP anywhere. I don't think facebook still uses it.
