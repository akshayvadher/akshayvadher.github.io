[{"content":"When you starting a new project, choosing a programming language is a hard choice. Here is my take.\nOn one had you might want to chose a cool languge but on other hand you might want to chose a stable language.\nFor web servers or any general-purpose production system\n My criteria  Static typing Compiled Good community support Good libraries Good frameworks Functional Memory management Easy (relatively not steep learning curve)   My criteria - language choice Static typing (Because error-prone, Performance optimization)\nJava, C, Rust, Go (sorry python and javascript)\nCompiled (Performance, Memory)\nJava, C, Rust, Go\nGood community support (Don\u0026rsquo;t want to be alone using the best programming language)\nJava, C, Rust, Go, Python, Javascript\nGood libraries (Don\u0026rsquo;t want to reinvent the world)\nJava, Javascript, Python, Go\nGood frameworks (Library is okay but full fledge framework is required!)\nJava, Javascript, Python, Go(Still evolving)\nFunctional (I am not a rigid OOP guy)\nJavascript, Go\nMemory management (As they say, if you want to make a pie from scratch, you must first create the universe. C is good but Assembly is best. I need productivity.)\nJava (Nearly there), Javascript (lousy), Rust (Awesome), Go\nEasy (relatively not steep learning curve) (Need talent already knowing lang or can be learned easily)\nPython, Javascript, Go\nMy choice Go (easy, good syntax, static typing and compiles fast, many libraries, menial resource consumption)\nOther reasons apart from mentioned above\n No magic code (If you add @Transactional in spring, it takes care of starting, ending, and commiting your transactions. It is magic. But it is double edged sword. It can do harm if not coded properly. Go is IdiotProof) (Also it is hard to master the magic code. It would take weeks or months for anyone to learn Spring annotations or Ruby coding styles.) Minimal resource consumption (CPU, memory - spring takes 100+ MiB to start) Opinionated code (There are only minimal way you can code something - makes it easy to manage a large team and code base) Great threading (If you spin off 1000 thread in java with Thread.sleep(10 * 1000) then your app will become unresponsive. That doesn\u0026rsquo;t happen with go routines. At least it is not as bad as java) Many cloud native and open source tools are written in go. kubernetes, docker, and sops are some examples  What I don\u0026rsquo;t like about Go?\n Solid framework like spring (gin is available though! Not sure how good is that). Module management (Now they have!) No generics (Maybe that is for good!) (update, now they are adding that too) Extra things like liquibase integration (There are ways, but no out of box ways)  Edit 1\nKotlin, spring-native/micronaut, and GraalVM (Maybe)\n The day go will have all features as java, java will be as fast as go\n- Graeme Rocher (creator of Groovy, Grails, Micronaut)\n With GraalVM \u0026amp; spring-native or micronaut, we get compiled code\nWith Kotlin, we get awesome syntax, functional support within Java ecosystem. Also, with reactive java, we get around threading issues. Reactive itself is hard though.\nSo maybe Kotlin, spring-native/micronaut, and GraalVM. Depends on the preference of other stakeholders, existing knowledge, etc.\n Honorary mentions Python: Easy\nHowever, I think pandas, numpy, jupyter notebook are the reasons for python\u0026rsquo;s popularity\nGood to start but not good performance/memory wise in production\nContrary to popular belief I don\u0026rsquo;t like python. Because you need javascript in frontend for sure, some compiled lang in backend for sure then why learn a new language, use either of them - use max two!\nHuge respect though. Easiest to get started with. Not chosen because I am searching for prod server language.\nJava: Almost chose.\nYou go anywhere, you find java. You need to do anything, you can do it in java. The best thing, you don\u0026rsquo;t need to depend on any other languages like python/javascript which are just a wrapper of C code\nNot compiled. Still needs relatively higher memory - this is the reason I didn\u0026rsquo;t choose it, bit slower than compiled - at least I have been told so\nC: Best. But when I need a needle I won\u0026rsquo;t use a sword.\nC++: Controversial. Linus doesn\u0026rsquo;t like it. Anyways almost like C.\nRust: Awesome memory management.\nDoesn\u0026rsquo;t shine when need things faster - from my 30k feet view (correct me if I am wrong).\nAlso not good at frameworks.\nJavascript: Never thought it would become so popular.\nEasy.\nYou can do almost anything. Hugely error prone, lousy memory management\nHowever, bootstraping doesn\u0026rsquo;t require too much memory. For simple programs, it takes less than 100MBs as compared to java which requires 500MBs. Even if javascript requires chrome engine to work. I have chosen this for simple rest APIs or simple kafka consumers because of best time to market.\nNot to forget almost best event based paradigm. Love it for IO.\nTypescript: Huge fan.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t like it because it still compiles to javascript. Otherwise easy, great tooling, great community support. Great overall.\nThe day typescript will have its own compiler, I will use this.\nKotline, Scala, Groovy: What typescript is for javascript, these languages are for java\nClojure: Because Lisp. However not sure much. Still compiles to java!\nC#: Java\u0026rsquo;s brother (or Sister!). I am anyways opensource guy.\nPHP: Are they still using it! Wordpress. If you remove wordpress never seen PHP anywhere. I don\u0026rsquo;t think facebook still uses it.\nCredit Photo by Markus Spiske on Unsplash\n","permalink":"https://akshayvadher.github.io/posts/the-programming-language-i-am-excited-to-use/","summary":"When you starting a new project, choosing a programming language is a hard choice.

The deadline was near and the work was mammoth. There was no way we could complete the given work on deadline.\nOn top of that, we had multiple issues. My team leader had a nervous breakdown. Other team members were lethargic ü•¥. I just got a fracture in my leg. The manager was eager to complete the work in any way.\nI felt like I was the only one taking all the work on my shoulder. I felt tired üò´.\nOne day we had so many open items for me, I was overwhelmed, I didn\u0026rsquo;t know where to start, the problems were so complex - it felt way out of my league, nobody there to help, everyone expecting me to complete everything. It was frustrating. I felt numb üòë.\nI did something any impatient person would do. I left. In the middle of the day. Left everything. All I wanted was to not think about work, go home and rest. Maybe I won\u0026rsquo;t come to work the next day. Or ever!\nThen something happened.\nAs I was leaving, the watchman was standing outside of the building. Out of blue, he started talking to me.\nThis was his problem: A few days ago, he missed starting his shift on time, he was late for 15 mins. A senior manager had to attend a call from the office and the office was locked (because the security guy was not available). The manager complained to the security firm. The security firm expelled him from the job.\nThis was not enough, his salary was around ‚Çπ5000. The standard cost of living in India would be ‚Çπ15000 I assume. He had at least 2 kids and a wife. He was living off on a menial salary but this time he didn\u0026rsquo;t have anything. He didn\u0026rsquo;t know how he would provide for food - for his kids.\nHe wanted to leave everything. He wanted to leave his organization and go back to his village.\nSuddenly my problems seemed tiny. I didn\u0026rsquo;t have a family to provide for. I didn\u0026rsquo;t have any liability. I was earning more than the standard cost of living. My parents were well off. I had luxury of getting good education. He had real problems.\nI never had to think about food, a roof, or clothes.\nI turned around. Went to the office. Started working on problems one at a time (problem solving is not hard, you just have to take one step at a time. Tiny steps. Not think about everything at hand. Different topic though. We will talk about this in detail in another post). Suddenly my engineering lead came for help, he put other good members to the team, I started getting help. We were about to deliver the product on time - of course with countless sleepless nights.\nThe conclusion: When you feel low, think about real problems people might have, ours are simple. Work on a single tiny doable item.\nP.S. Now I think that day, I should have helped him in any way possible; maybe financial. I was naive back then.\nP.P.S. Still, over the time I\u0026rsquo;ve learnt that, though some have bigger and real issues, some issues are as hurting as the real ones. For example, being in depression or loosing a parent; issue with those issues is, everyday you have to live that issue, there isn\u0026rsquo;t anything you can do to rever or get around. Seek professional help for those.\nCredit Photo by Benjamin Davies on Unsplash\n","permalink":"https://akshayvadher.github.io/posts/when-i-felt-low-i-got-motivation-booster-hard-way/","summary":"There was a time when I felt low.
