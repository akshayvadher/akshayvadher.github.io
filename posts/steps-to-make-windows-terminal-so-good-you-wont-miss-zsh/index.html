The biggest thing I missed - ZSH and Oh My Zsh.\nWorking with windows cmd or Powershell is just pathetic. You try to execute ls command and turned out, it is not supported.\nWhat do I need from a command prompt? Following are all the capabilities from a shell/prompt/terminal\nTabs and Tiling (I used Tilix in Ubuntu/PopOs) A bit of Jazz (Colors, Icons, Emojis) (OhMyZ suffice this and following all things) Information about current dir (Example, using git plugin, shell shows current branch, number of commits to push, etc.) Autocompletion (Folder structure) Autocompletion (Commands based on history) (This is most important for me) Familiarity (It should support relatively same commands. Example ls) Interaction with other tools (Like opening VSCode, editing file, installing pieces of software) Windows alternative After installing a few components, the shell in windows became so powerful that I don’t desire to switch back to linux.\nTurned out, the only thing I missed about linux is its terminal capability.\nWhich alternatives in windows solved all issues\nTabs and Tiling (Windows Terminal) Jazz (Starship, Nerd Fonts) Plugin (Starship Plugins) Autocompletion (Powershell 7 native feature) Autocompletion (Commands based on history - Powershell 7 native feature) Familiarity (Powershell 7 supports many such commands; ls, curl are two examples) Interaction (Powershell 7, chocolatey) Steps to install Powershell 7 Follow this link and from the releases page, download .msi and double click install.\nNerd Fonts It powers all the Jazz for terminal like showing icons, emojis, and ligatures. Follow this link and download any font you like. Fira Code is the most popular. Install after downloading.\nWindows Terminal Follow this link. It will open a web page that will redirect to Windows store. Install from Windows store.\nSet default profile to Powershell 7: Open Windows terminal 🡪 Open settings (That down arrow in the top bar) 🡪 Set Default Profile as “Powershell” (the black icon one, not the blue “Windows Powershell”)\nSet Fonts: Settings 🡪 Profiles (left menu) 🡪 Powershell 🡪 Appearance 🡪 Font face 🡪 Select the installed Nerd font. You can change the color scheme too, Solarized Dark was my favorite one time.\nChocolatey This step is optional, but it will help installing software from terminal easily.\nInstall chocolatey from the link.\nUsage 🡪 choco install jre8\nStarship Before installing Starship, I tried Oh My Posh. It was good, it can totally emulate Oh My Zsh. However, I found Starship more elegant.\nThe best way to install Starship is using chocolatey. Or follow starship docs and install via some other way.\nchoco install starship Create or Open profile file.\ncode $PROFILE // OR if VS Code is not installed notepad $PROFILE This will create a file named Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1 in your Users 🡪 \u003c User \u003e 🡪 Documents 🡪 Powershell directory. This file is the same as .zshrc or .bashrc file. You can provide initial commands, aliases, etc.\nSet Starship as the default shell. Put this inside the profile file so that every time you open the terminal, it loads Starship.\nInvoke-Expression (\u0026starship init powershell) Customize (Add Jazz) to Starship. However, I won’t recommend doing this right away. First, setup everything and start using it all and then come back to this and tweak however you like.\nIf you still want to configure, I will add my configuration file below. Paste that code to your C:\\Users\\\\.config\\starship.toml file. Or some presets are available here\nadd_newline = true # Replace the \"❯\" symbol in the prompt with \"➜\" [character] # The name of the module we are configuring is \"character\" success_symbol = \"[➜](bold green)\" # The \"success_symbol\" segment is being set to \"➜\" with the color \"bold green\" # Disable the package module, hiding it from the prompt completely [package] disabled = true [cmd_duration] min_time = 1_000 # Show command duration over 10,000 milliseconds (=10 sec) format = \" took [$duration]($style)\" [git_commit] commit_hash_length = 8 style = \"bold white\" [git_state] format = '[\\($state( $progress_current of $progress_total)\\)]($style) ' [git_status] conflicted = \"⚔️ \" ahead = \"🏎️ 💨 ×${count}\" behind = \"🐢 ×${count}\" diverged = \"🔱 🏎️ 💨 ×${ahead_count} 🐢 ×${behind_count}\" untracked = \"🛤️ ×${count}\" stashed = \"📦 \" modified = \"📝 ×${count}\" staged = \"🗃️ ×${count}\" renamed = \"📛 ×${count}\" deleted = \"🗑️ ×${count}\" style = \"bright-white\" format = \"$all_status$ahead_behind\" [memory_usage] format = \"$symbol[${ram}( | ${swap})]($style) \" threshold = 70 style = \"bold dimmed white\" disabled = false [golang] format = \"via [🏎💨 $version](bold cyan) \" [kubernetes] format = 'k8s [⛵ ($user on )($cluster in )$context \\($namespace\\)](green) ' disabled = false [kubernetes.context_aliases] \"arn:aws:eks::ACCOUNT_ID_HERE:cluster/dev\" = \"dev\" \"arn:aws:eks::ACCOUNT_ID_HERE:cluster/test\" = \"test\" \".*/openshift-cluster/.*\" = \"openshift\" \"gke_.*_(?P[\\\\w-]+)\" = \"gke-$var_cluster\" [battery] full_symbol = \"🔋 \" charging_symbol = \"⚡️ \" discharging_symbol = \"💀 \" [[battery.display]] threshold = 30 style = \"bold red\" Autocompletion Put the following lines in your profile file and you are done\nSet-PSReadlineKeyHandler -Key Tab -Function MenuComplete Set-PSReadlineKeyHandler -Key UpArrow -Function HistorySearchBackward Set-PSReadlineKeyHandler -Key DownArrow -Function HistorySearchForward Controversial opinion, after using this for some time, I found this autocompletion better than what we had in ZSH.\nIf you want to execute commands from history then type a few characters from command the hit ⬆️ it will show all the commands from history. For example, if you type docker + ⬆️ then it will show docker build . (in case you executed that in history)\nThe best thing, using tab you can have auto suggest for the commands you never executed. Like if I type git and tab, it will show git fetch, git pull, basically all the possible commands I can execute using git. (Update, I might have installed posh git and that might be doing it)\nAlias If you want to set up an alias then open the profile file and set alias like\nSet-Alias k kubectl; Set-Alias ka getAllKubernetes; function getAllKubernetes(){ kubectl get po,no,svc,ing --all-namespaces; kubectl get cm,secret -n app } Search We miss grep in Windows. There is almost similar utility in Windows called findstr. Usage ⬇️⬇\ncat file.txt | findstr \"search\" Env variable This is not directly related but this comes a lot. It is easy to set env variable in Linux. export ENV_A=\"ABC\". Also, all the setup guideline of any software assume that you are on Linux and will provide the export based command in the example.\nHowever, powershell has different syntax; Use following syntax if you want to set any environment variable.\n$env:MY_ENV_VARIABLE = \"VALUE\" // to set $env:MY_ENV_VARIABLE // to print/get Back Search Cltr + r will do the back search the same as Linux terminal\nTabs and Tiling Tabs are by default available in Windows Powershell. The shortcuts are,\nCrtl + Shift + T to open a new tab\nCrtl + Shift + W to close a tab\nCrtl + Shift + Tab to switch to the previous tab\nCrtl + Tab to switch to the next tab\nTiling is by default available as well. The shortcuts are,\nAlt + Shift + D or Alt + Shift + + to split the terminal vertically\nAlt + Shift + - to split the terminal horizontally\nAlt + Arrow to move the focus to the next pane\nAlt + Shift + Arrow to resize the pane\nLinux inside windows You can still enable wsl 2 inside windows and make use of all the features of Windows terminal and still can use Linux under the hood. It is a different topic and requires its own post.\nI sometimes use git bash where someone has written a linux specific script and I don’t want to spin off WSL just for one command.\nHTTP client This is probably a different topic. But we need to use CURL a lot. There are multiple ways.\nInstall curl using choco and use it. choco install curl Use Invoke-WebRequest in powershell. It is a built-in command. (though it is not that good) Use HTTPie. choco install httpie. It is way more convenient than curl and Invoke-WebRequest. Example ⬇️⬇ http :8080/api/v1/health a=b Here it will automatically consider localhost as host. Also, as we have passed a=b it will automatically consider it as a POST request with Content-Type: application/json and body as {\"a\":\"b\"}.\nConclusion Maybe it might look complex to set up, and it might not be as powerful as other alternatives. But these things are tools not toys. If those help me get things done then I am happy.\n","wordCount":"1386","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://www.iaxy.in/posts/steps-to-make-windows-terminal-so-good-you-wont-miss-zsh/windows-terminal.jpg","datePublished":"2022-03-02T00:44:06+05:30","dateModified":"2022-03-02T00:44:06+05:30","author":[{"@type":"Person","name":"Akshay Vadher"}],"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.iaxy.in/posts/steps-to-make-windows-terminal-so-good-you-wont-miss-zsh/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Akshay Vadher","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://www.iaxy.in/favicon_io/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://www.iaxy.in/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)">Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button><ul class=lang-switch><li>|</li></ul></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://www.iaxy.in/categories/tech title=Tech><span>Tech</span></a></li><li><a href=https://www.iaxy.in/categories/personal title=Personal><span>Personal</span></a></li><li><a href=https://www.iaxy.in/search/ title="Search (Alt + /)" accesskey=/><span>Search</span></a></li><li><a href=https://www.iaxy.in/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://www.iaxy.in/about-me/ title="About Me"><span>About Me</span></a></li><li><a href=https://www.iaxy.in/now/ title=Now><span>Now</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://www.iaxy.in/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://www.iaxy.in/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Steps to Make Windows Terminal So Good You Won't Miss Zsh</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2022-03-02 00:44:06 +0530 +0530'>March 2, 2022</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;7 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;Akshay Vadher&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/akshayvadher/akshayvadher.github.io/tree/main/content/posts/steps-to-make-windows-terminal-so-good-you-wont-miss-zsh/index.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><img loading=lazy src=windows-terminal.jpg alt="Windows Terminal Image"></p><p>A few months ago I switched to Windows.

Set-PSReadlineKeyHandler -Key UpArrow -Function HistorySearchBackward
Set-PSReadlineKeyHandler -Key DownArrow -Function HistorySearchForward
</code></pre><p>Controversial opinion, after using this for some time, I found this autocompletion better than what we had in ZSH.</p><p>If you want to execute commands from history then type a few characters from command the hit <code>⬆️</code> it will show all the
commands from history.
For example, if you type <code>docker</code> + <code>⬆️</code> then it will show <code>docker build .</code> (in case you executed that in history)</p><p>The best thing, using <code>tab</code> you can have auto suggest for the commands you never executed. Like if I type <code>git</code>
and <code>tab</code>, it will show <code>git fetch</code>, <code>git pull</code>, basically all the possible commands I can execute using git. (Update, I
might have installed <code>posh git</code> and that might be doing it)</p><h4 id=alias>Alias<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#alias>#</a></h4><p>If you want to set up an alias then open the profile file and set alias like</p><pre tabindex=0><code>Set-Alias k kubectl;
Set-Alias ka getAllKubernetes;


function getAllKubernetes(){
  kubectl get po,no,svc,ing --all-namespaces;
  kubectl get cm,secret -n app
}
</code></pre><h4 id=search>Search<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#search>#</a></h4><p>We miss <code>grep</code> in Windows. There is almost similar utility in Windows called <code>findstr</code>. Usage ⬇️⬇</p><pre tabindex=0><code>cat file.txt | findstr &#34;search&#34;
</code></pre><h4 id=env-variable>Env variable<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#env-variable>#</a></h4><p>This is not directly related but this comes a lot. It is easy to set env variable in Linux. <code>export ENV_A="ABC"</code>. Also,
all the setup guideline of any software assume that you are on Linux and will provide the <code>export</code> based command in the
example.</p><p>However, powershell has different syntax; Use following syntax if you want to set any environment variable.</p><pre tabindex=0><code>$env:MY_ENV_VARIABLE = &#34;VALUE&#34; // to set
$env:MY_ENV_VARIABLE // to print/get
</code></pre><h4 id=back-search>Back Search<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#back-search>#</a></h4><p><code>Cltr + r</code> will do the back search the same as Linux terminal</p><h4 id=tabs-and-tiling>Tabs and Tiling<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#tabs-and-tiling>#</a></h4><p>Tabs are by default available in Windows Powershell. The shortcuts are,</p><p><code>Crtl + Shift + T</code> to open a new tab</p><p><code>Crtl + Shift + W</code> to close a tab</p><p><code>Crtl + Shift + Tab</code> to switch to the previous tab</p><p><code>Crtl + Tab</code> to switch to the next tab</p><p>Tiling is by default available as well. The shortcuts are,</p><p><code>Alt + Shift + D</code> or <code>Alt + Shift + +</code> to split the terminal vertically</p><p><code>Alt + Shift + -</code> to split the terminal horizontally</p><p><code>Alt + Arrow</code> to move the focus to the next pane</p><p><code>Alt + Shift + Arrow</code> to resize the pane</p><h4 id=linux-inside-windows>Linux inside windows<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#linux-inside-windows>#</a></h4><p>You can still enable <code>wsl 2</code> inside windows and make use of all the features of Windows terminal and still can use Linux
under the hood. It is a different topic and requires its own post.</p><p>I sometimes use <code>git bash</code> where someone has written a linux specific script and I don&rsquo;t want to spin off WSL just for
one command.</p><h4 id=http-client>HTTP client<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#http-client>#</a></h4><p>This is probably a different topic. But we need to use CURL a lot. There are multiple ways.</p><ol><li>Install <code>curl</code> using <code>choco</code> and use it. <code>choco install curl</code></li><li>Use <code>Invoke-WebRequest</code> in powershell. It is a built-in command. (though it is not that good)</li><li>Use <code>HTTPie</code>. <code>choco install httpie</code>. It is way more convenient than <code>curl</code> and <code>Invoke-WebRequest</code>. Example ⬇️⬇</li></ol><pre tabindex=0><code>http :8080/api/v1/health a=b
</code></pre><p>Here it will automatically consider localhost as host. Also, as we have passed <code>a=b</code> it will automatically consider it
as a POST request with <code>Content-Type: application/json</code> and body as <code>{"a":"b"}</code>.</p><h3 id=conclusion>Conclusion<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#conclusion>#</a></h3><p>Maybe it might look complex to set up, and it might not be as powerful as other alternatives. But these things are tools
not toys. If those help me get things done then I am happy.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags><li><a href=https://www.iaxy.in/tags/tech/>Tech</a></li><li><a href=https://www.iaxy.in/tags/terminal/>Terminal</a></li><li><a href=https://www.iaxy.in/tags/windows/>Windows</a></li><li><a href=https://www.iaxy.in/tags/setup/>Setup</a></li><li><a href=https://www.iaxy.in/tags/steps/>Steps</a></li></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://www.iaxy.in/posts/why-go/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Why Go</span></a></nav><div class=share-buttons><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="share Steps to Make Windows Terminal So Good You Won't Miss Zsh on twitter" href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet/?text=Steps%20to%20Make%20Windows%20Terminal%20So%20Good%20You%20Won%27t%20Miss%20Zsh&amp;url=https%3a%2f%2fwww.iaxy.in%2fposts%2fsteps-to-make-windows-terminal-so-good-you-wont-miss-zsh%2f&amp;hashtags=tech%2cterminal%2cwindows%2csetup%2csteps"><svg viewBox="0 0 512 512" height="30" width="30" fill="currentcolor"><path d="M449.446.0C483.971.0 512 28.03 512 62.554v386.892C512 483.97 483.97 512 449.446 512H62.554c-34.524.0-62.554-28.03-62.554-62.554V62.554c0-34.524 28.029-62.554 62.554-62.554h386.892zM195.519 424.544c135.939.0 210.268-112.643 210.268-210.268.0-3.218.0-6.437-.153-9.502 14.406-10.421 26.973-23.448 36.935-38.314-13.18 5.824-27.433 9.809-42.452 11.648 15.326-9.196 26.973-23.602 32.49-40.92-14.252 8.429-30.038 14.56-46.896 17.931-13.487-14.406-32.644-23.295-53.946-23.295-40.767.0-73.87 33.104-73.87 73.87.0 5.824.613 11.494 1.992 16.858-61.456-3.065-115.862-32.49-152.337-77.241-6.284 10.881-9.962 23.601-9.962 37.088.0 25.594 13.027 48.276 32.95 61.456-12.107-.307-23.448-3.678-33.41-9.196v.92c0 35.862 25.441 65.594 59.311 72.49-6.13 1.686-12.72 2.606-19.464 2.606-4.751.0-9.348-.46-13.946-1.38 9.349 29.426 36.628 50.728 68.965 51.341-25.287 19.771-57.164 31.571-91.8 31.571-5.977.0-11.801-.306-17.625-1.073 32.337 21.15 71.264 33.41 112.95 33.41z"/></svg>
